## Overview

This is a modern, responsive professional portfolio website built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The portfolio features a single-page application (SPA) design with smooth navigation between different sections including home, projects, research, journey, and contact. The website emphasizes clean design, professional presentation, and mobile-first responsiveness.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Technology Stack**: Vanilla HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Design Pattern**: Single Page Application (SPA) with section-based navigation
- **Styling Approach**: Custom CSS with CSS variables for theming and responsive design
- **Font Integration**: Google Fonts (Inter family) and Font Awesome icons
- **Responsive Strategy**: Mobile-first design with CSS Grid and Flexbox

### Key Design Decisions
- **Vanilla JavaScript Choice**: Eliminates framework dependencies, ensures fast loading times, and provides full control over functionality
- **CSS Variables**: Centralized theming system for consistent color scheme and easy maintenance
- **Backdrop Filter**: Modern glassmorphism effect on navigation for visual appeal
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without JavaScript, enhanced with interactive features
